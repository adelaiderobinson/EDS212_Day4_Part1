## Leslie Matrix example

Model population changes using the same example we did in lecture

```{r}
#putting vectore within the matrix function
insect_leslie <- matrix(data=c(0, 0, 600, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.8, 0), nrow =3 ,ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
insect_leslie

```

```{r}
#create a vector for the initial condition values
#12000 eggs, 700 larvae, 500 females in year zero
insect_y0 <- c(12000, 700, 500)
```

```{r}
#multiply these to find the initial condition
#use symbol for the dot product
insect_y1 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y0
insect_y1
```

Estimate populations at each life stage at year 2 and year three

```{r}
#be careful of order 
insect_y2 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y1
insect_y3 <- insect_leslie  %*% insect_y2
```
